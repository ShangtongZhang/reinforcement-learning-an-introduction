"""
Tile Coding Software version 3.0beta
by Rich Sutton
based on a program created by Steph Schaeffer and others
External documentation and recommendations on the use of this code is available in the
reinforcement learning textbook by Sutton and Barto, and on the web.
These need to be understood before this code is.

This software is for Python 3 or more.

This is an implementation of grid-style tile codings, based originally on
the UNH CMAC code (see http://www.ece.unh.edu/robots/cmac.htm), but by now highly changed.
Here we provide a function, "tiles", that maps floating and integer
variables to a list of tiles, and a second function "tiles-wrap" that does the same while
wrapping some floats to provided widths (the lower wrap value is always 0).

The float variables will be gridded at unit intervals, so generalization
will be by approximately 1 in each direction, and any scaling will have
to be done externally before calling tiles.

Num-tilings should be a power of 2, e.g., 16. To make the offsetting work properly, it should
also be greater than or equal to four times the number of floats.

The first argument is either an index hash table of a given size (created by (make-iht size)),
an integer "size" (range of the indices from 0), or nil (for testing, indicating that the tile
coordinates are to be returned without being converted to indices).
